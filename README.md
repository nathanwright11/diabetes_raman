# diabetes_raman
 
 
This program uses a neural network to predict if a patient has diabetes. The dataset contains raman spectroscopy measurements taken from four locations on the patients skin: left earlobe, left inner arm, left thumbnail, and the left median cubital vein. 

There is one dataset for each location measurement, four datasets in total. Each dataset has high dimensionality with over 3100 features. The sample size is also extremely small, with only 20 patients measured. The output classes are balanced, with 10 healthy and 10 diabetic patients measured. 


Dataset came from Kaggle submitted by user Edgar Guevara.
